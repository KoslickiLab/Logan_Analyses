FIX: Read Error in run_all_coverages.sh
========================================

Error:
------
"read: read error: 0: Bad file descriptor"

Cause:
------
The script redirects stdout/stderr to `tee` for logging before the interactive
`read` command runs. This breaks the `read` command's ability to read from the
terminal (stdin).

Solution:
---------
Changed line 44 from:
    read -p "Continue? (y/n) " -n 1 -r

To:
    read -p "Continue? (y/n) " -n 1 -r < /dev/tty

The `< /dev/tty` explicitly tells `read` to get input from the terminal device,
even when stdin/stdout have been redirected for logging.

Alternative for Non-Interactive Use:
------------------------------------
If you want to skip the confirmation prompt entirely (e.g., for automated runs):

    yes | bash run_all_coverages.sh

This pipes 'y' to the script automatically.

Or edit the script to remove the confirmation section entirely (lines 44-50).
